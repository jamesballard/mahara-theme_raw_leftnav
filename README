MAhara Raw Left Navigation Theme
================================

Copyright 2012 Unviersity of London Computer Centre (ULCC)

This is a customisation of the Mahara Raw theme that creates the 2nd row (sub-nav) as a left-hand vertical navigation menu rather than a horizontal menu.

You can use this to as a basis to then add your own branding and colour design.

Usage
=====

Rename the downloaded folder as 'raw_leftnav' and place in your Mahara themes directory: mahara/theme 

When creating your own theme set the following in the themeconfig.php file:

$theme->displayname   = 'Your theme name';
$theme->parent = 'raw_leftnav';

You will now have an alternative naivation model

An example can be found at http://mahara.ulcc.ac.uk

Requirements
============

This is only tested for Mahara 1.4.x and will be updated for future releases.
